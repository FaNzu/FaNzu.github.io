## Description

Dear Brunnerne,

Hello dear, it's your Grannie E.

My lovely nurse took me out today and I found where I used to go see movies! Back in my day movies didn't talk or have sound! How the times have changed. I've added in a photo from back when I used to live there, with help from my nurse.

I'm going for a cuppa now, will call later.

Love,
Grannie E.
