## Description

e-dog has been alone in the downunderctf.com email server for so long, please yeet him an email of some of your pets to keep him company, he might even share his favourite toy with you.

He has a knack for hiding things one layer deeper than you would expect.

## Summary and solution

By sending an email to `e-dog@downunderctf.com` you get a response, which on the surface doesnt seem to have the flag. But viewing the original text for the email, reveals the flag

## ✅ Final Flag
