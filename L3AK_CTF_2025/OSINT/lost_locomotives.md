## Summary

We were dropped on a railway line with a mountainous backdrop and tasked with identifying the exact location. The challenge was to track the train — and we did just that.

## Investigation

A reverse image search on the screenshot led us to an exact visual match in a [travel blog post](https://travelasfamily.com/MacchuPicchu), which discussed a train route leading to Machu Picchu.

The surrounding scenery, train design, and specific architectural details matched Ollantaytambo, a popular departure point for trains into the Sacred Valley of Peru.
