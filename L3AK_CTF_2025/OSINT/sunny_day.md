## Summary

A bright and mountainous village scene was the starting point for this challenge. With just a few key visual features, we were able to pinpoint the exact location.

## Investigation

A simple reverse image search on the photo revealed that this picturesque spot is in Liechtenstein, specifically in the village of Triesenberg.

From there, we lined up the church tower, road layout, and mountainscape with satellite and street view imagery.
