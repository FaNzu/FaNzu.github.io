## Summary

We were given a photo of an elephant enclosure and asked to locate its exact geographic coordinates. From there, we would uncover the flag.

## Investigation

Using a reverse image search on the provided photo, we identified the location as the elephant enclosure at the Singapore Zoo.

We cross-referenced the enclosure's structure with the [official Singapore Zoo map (PDF)](https://www.mandai.com/content/dam/mandai/singapore-zoo/park-map/sz-en-map.pdf). By comparing it to satellite imagery, we were able to pinpoint the enclosure on Google Maps:
