## Summary

This OSINT challenge gave us a rural-looking road with a distant structure and what appeared to be a stork nest on top of a pole — a promising but tricky lead. We didn't manage to solve it in time, but here's what we uncovered.
Investigation Notes

We focused on several environmental clues:

    White roadside flowers, commonly found in Estonia

    Traffic sign: The left-turn sign design matched Estonian road signage

    Utility pole nest: A large stork nest on top of a wooden pole, which is quite common in rural Estonia

This led us to believe the location was somewhere in Estonia.

## The Stork Nest Database

We found an Estonian conservation site that tracks stork nests:

Our plan was to cross-reference active nest locations with timestamped photos and satellite imagery, but we ran out of time before we could pursue this overlap method in detail.
