We were never able to find this place, but we spend alot of time on this. So this will be a compilation of the information we where able to find on this.

We quickly figured it was in sweden, due to the yellow/red road sign, orange snow indicator, red house. We also suspect it is on öland or Gotland due to these places are known for their windmills.

## Update after ctf ended

aparently it was on a [windmill database](https://milldatabase.org/mills/sweden-windmill-224ba7a5-d8cc-4a96-a3c6-9629768c32c9)

Also the compass didnt match road in the end 💀
