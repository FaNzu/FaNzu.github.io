[Back to overview](../Overview.md)


The game is in the current phase about a lighthouse keeper, trying to maintain this lighthouse of the coast of england.
But while staying in the lighthouse, strange things happen. Weird radio calls, things showing up, things goes missing, noises, storms and more.

Also a pet seagull called Burp :D

## How I came up with it

After watching [a youtube video](https://youtu.be/m81KWrfJED0?si=z8vO1O-_PnYj1dkS) about maintaining this specific lighthouse. It made me realise how lonely it must have been for the original lighthouse keepers when they used to be here alone in unforgiving weather.

The game would, be a story driven atmospheric game, with slight physic horror elements. 

## Why this game

This game was mentioned before inspired by a specific video, but i have for a while considering a photo collection of the danish lighthouses around denmark. As an excuse to come out and complete a full process. So i already had lighthouses on mind.

This game has 2 goals for me personally, i would like to try and dip my toes in 3d modelling, animation, game design etc.

Secondly trying to release a full game, from prototyping, beta, play tests, full release, and maintains for a while after. This would also require potential voice actors, music, sound design and more.

## Challenges

I have yet to figure out the art style, and the gameplay style.

I am currently considering 2 kind of styles i am considering. A first person style like firewatch. This Would allow for the easiest path as there are plenty of tutorials for this kind of games.

Second idea, is a isometric 3d style game. Where the camera rotates around the center of the lighthouse. And a sphere around the camera, would make those items transparent, allowing the user to see through walls, items, etc. This would however be new territory for me, and would be quite the challenge. Would however also be a unuiqe style, and set this game apart from others.
