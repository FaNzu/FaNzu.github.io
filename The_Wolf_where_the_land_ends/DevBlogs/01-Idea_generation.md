# Idea Generation
_13-08-2025_

[Back to overview](../Overview.md)

---

The game is currently in the concept phase. The core idea: you play as a lighthouse keeper on the coast of England, tasked with keeping the light running and surviving the isolation.

But while staying in the lighthouse, strange things begin to happen ‚Äî unusual radio calls, items vanishing or appearing, odd noises, violent storms, and more.  
And of course‚Ä¶ a pet seagull named **Burp** üê¶.

## How the Idea Started

This came after watching [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/m81KWrfJED0?si=z8vO1O-_PnYj1dkS) about the upkeep of a specific lighthouse. It made me think about the loneliness faced by lighthouse keepers in harsh, remote conditions.

The game would be a **story-driven, atmospheric experience** with mild psychological horror elements ‚Äî a bit like *Firewatch*, but with the confined, intimate setting of a lighthouse. The smaller environment would help keep scope reasonable, while a simple art style could still allow for detail and atmosphere without ballooning development time.

## Why This Game

Lighthouses have been on my mind for a while ‚Äî I‚Äôd already considered doing a photo project of Danish lighthouses, so this naturally clicked.

For me, this game has two personal goals:

1. **Creative skills** ‚Äî experimenting with 3D modeling, animation, game design, and atmosphere-building.
2. **Full release experience** ‚Äî taking a project from prototype to beta, through playtesting, release, and post-launch maintenance. This includes collaboration with potential voice actors, musicians, and sound designers.

## Challenges

Two big questions remain:

- **Art style** ‚Äî keep it realistic, stylized, or something in between?
- **Gameplay style** ‚Äî
    - *First-person*: Easier to develop thanks to a wealth of tutorials, similar to *Firewatch*.
    - *Isometric 3D*: Camera orbits the lighthouse, with transparent occlusion for walls/furniture. More unique, but a bigger technical challenge.
